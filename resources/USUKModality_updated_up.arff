The recipient may rely on copy of the loan document , a written statement from the bank , or similar documentation -LRB- such as written lien instruction from the issuer of the instrument -RRB- to substantiate that the instrument constitutes loan proceeds . -LRB- 4 -RRB- Exception for certain installment sales . cashier \'s check , bank draft , traveler’ check , or money order received in designated reporting transaction is not treated as currency pursuant to paragraph -LRB- c -RRB- -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- ii -RRB- -LRB- A -RRB- of this section if the instrument is received in payment on promissory note or an installment sales contract -LRB- including lease that is considered to be a sale for Federal income tax purposes -RRB- . However , the preceding sentence applies only if— -LRB- i -RRB- Promissory notes or installment sales contracts with the same or substantially similar terms are used in the ordinary course of the recipient’ trade or business in connection with sales to ultimate consumers ; and -LRB- ii -RRB- The total amount of payments with respect to the sale that are received on or before the 60th day after the date of the sale does not exceed 50 percent of the purchase price of the sale . -LRB- 5 -RRB- Exception for certain down payment plans . cashier \'s check , bank draft , traveler’ check , or money order received in designated reporting transaction is not treated as currency pursuant to paragraph -LRB- c -RRB- -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- ii -RRB- -LRB- A -RRB- of this section if the instrument is received pursuant to payment plan requiring one or more down payments and the payment of the balance of the purchase price by date no later than the date of the sale -LRB- in the case of an item of travel or entertainment , date no later than the earliest date that any item of travel or entertainment pertaining to the same trip or event is furnished -RRB- .

The following examples illustrate the definition of ‘‘currency’’ set forth in paragraphs -LRB- c -RRB- -LRB- 1 -RRB- through -LRB- c -RRB- -LRB- 5 -RRB- of this section : Example 1 . D , an individual , purchases gold coins from M , coin dealer , for $ 13 , 200 . tenders to M in payment United States currency in the amount of $ 6 , 200 and cashier \'s check in the face amount of $ 7 , 000 which had purchased . Because the sale is designated reporting transaction , the cashier’ check is treated as currency for purposes of 31 U.S.C. 5331 and this section . Therefore , because has received more than $ 10 , 000 in currency with respect to the transaction , must make the report required by 31 U.S.C. 5331 and this section . E , an individual , purchases an automobile from Q , an automobile dealer , for $ 11 , 500 . tenders to Q in payment United States currency in the amount of $ 2 , 000 and cashier \'s check payable to E and Q in the amount of $ 9 , 500 . The cashier’ check constitutes the proceeds of loan from the bank issuing the check . The origin of the proceeds is evident from provisions inserted by the bank on the check that instruct the dealer to cause lien to be placed on the vehicle as security for the loan . The sale of the automobile is designated reporting transaction . However , under paragraph -LRB- c -RRB- -LRB- 3 -RRB- of this section , because has furnished Q documentary information establishing that the cashier’ check constitutes the proceeds of loan from the bank issuing the check , the cashier’ check is not treated as currency pursuant to paragraph -LRB- c -RRB- -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- ii -RRB- -LRB- A -RRB- of this section . F , an individual , purchases an item of jewelry from S , retail jeweler , for $ 12 , 000 . gives S traveler \'s checks totaling $ 2 , 400 and pays the balance with personal check payable to in the amount of $ 9 , 600 . Because the sale is designated reporting transaction , the traveler’ checks are treated as currency for purposes of section 5331 and this section . However , because the personal check is not treated as currency for purposes of section 5331 and this section , has not received more than $ 10 , 000 in currency in the transaction and no report is required to be filed under section 5331 and this section . G , an individual , purchases boat from T , a boat dealer , for $ 16 , 500 . G pays with a cashier \'s check payable to T in the amount of $ 16 , 500 . The cashier’ check is not treated as currency because the face amount of the check is more than $ 10 , 000 . Thus , no report is required to be made by under section 5331 and this section . H , an individual , arranges with W , travel agent , for the chartering of a passenger aircraft to transport group of individuals to sports event in another city . also arranges with W for hotel accommodations for the group and for admission tickets to the sports event . In payment , tenders to W money orders which had previously purchased . The total amount of the money orders , none of which individually exceeds $ 10 , 000 in face amount , exceeds $ 10 , 000 . Because the transaction is designated reporting transaction , the money orders are treated as currency for purposes of section 5331 and this section . Therefore , because has received more than $ 10 , 000 in currency with respect to the transaction , must make the report required by section 5331 and this section . -LRB- 7 -RRB- Consumer durable . The term consumer durable means an item of tangible personal property of type that is suitable under ordinary usage for personal consumption or use , that can reasonably be expected to be useful for at least year under ordinary usage , and that has sales price of more than $ 10 , 000 . Thus , for example , $ 20 , 000 automobile is consumer durable -LRB- whether or not it is sold for business use -RRB- , but $ 20 , 000 dump truck or a $ 20 , 000 factory machine is not . -LRB- 8 -RRB- Collectible . The term collectible means an item described in paragraphs -LRB- A -RRB- through -LRB- D -RRB- of section 408 -LRB- m -RRB- -LRB- 2 -RRB- of title 26 of the United States Code -LRB- determined without regard to section 408 -LRB- m -RRB- -LRB- 3 -RRB- of title 26 of the United States Code -RRB- . -LRB- 9 -RRB- Travel or entertainment activity . The term travel or entertainment activity means an item of travel or entertainment -LRB- within the meaning of 26 CFR 1.274–2 -LRB- b -RRB- -LRB- 1 -RRB- -RRB- pertaining to single trip or event where the aggregate sales price of the item and all other items pertaining to the same trip or event that are sold in the same transaction -LRB- or related transactions -RRB- exceeds $ 10 , 000 . -LRB- 10 -RRB- Retail sale .

In this context , transactions include -LRB- but are not limited to -RRB- sale of goods or services ; sale of real property ; sale of intangible property ; a rental of real or personal property ; an exchange of currency for other currency ; the establishment or maintenance of or contribution to custodial , trust , or escrow arrangement ; payment of a preexisting debt ; conversion of currency to negotiable instrument ; a reimbursement for expenses paid ; or the making or repayment of loan . A transaction may not be divided into multiple transactions in order to avoid reporting under this section . -LRB- ii -RRB- The term related transactions means any transaction conducted between payer -LRB- or its agent -RRB- and a recipient of currency in 24-hour period . Additionally , transactions conducted between payer -LRB- or its agent -RRB- and currency recipient during a period of more than 24 hours are related if the recipient knows or has reason to know that each transaction is one of series of connected transactions . -LRB- iii -RRB- The following examples illustrate the definition of paragraphs -LRB- c -RRB- -LRB- 12 -RRB- -LRB- i -RRB- and -LRB- ii -RRB- of this section : Example 1 . person has a tacit agreement with gold dealer to purchase $ 36 , 000 in gold bullion . The $ 36 , 000 purchase represents single transaction under paragraph -LRB- c -RRB- -LRB- 12 -RRB- -LRB- i -RRB- of this section and the reporting requirements of this section can not be avoided by recasting the single sales transaction into separate $ 9 , 000 sales transactions . An attorney agrees to represent client in a criminal case with the attorney \'s fee to be determined on an hourly basis . In the first month in which the attorney represents the client , the bill for the attorney’ services comes to $ 8 , 000 which the client pays in currency . In the second month in which the attorney represents the client , the bill for the attorney’ services comes to $ 4 , 000 , which the client again pays in currency . The aggregate amount of currency paid -LRB- $ 12 , 000 -RRB- relates to single transaction as defined in paragraph -LRB- c -RRB- -LRB- 12 -RRB- -LRB- i -RRB- of this section , the sale of legal services relating to the criminal case , and the receipt of currency must be reported under this section . person intends to contribute total of $ 45 , 000 to a trust fund , and the trustee of the fund knows or has reason to know of that intention . The $ 45 , 000 contribution is single transaction under paragraph -LRB- c -RRB- -LRB- 12 -RRB- -LRB- i -RRB- of this section and the reporting requirement of this section can not be avoided by the grantor’ making five separate $ 9 , 000 contributions of currency to single fund or by making five $ 9 , 000 contributions of currency to five separate funds administered by common trustee . K , an individual , attends one day auction and purchases for currency two items , at cost of $ 9 , 240 and $ 1 , 732.50 respectively -LRB- tax and buyer’ premium included -RRB- . Because the transactions are related transactions as defined in paragraph -LRB- c -RRB- -LRB- 12 -RRB- -LRB- ii -RRB- of this section , the auction house is required to report the aggregate amount of currency received from the related sales -LRB- $ 10 , 972.50 -RRB- , even though the auction house accounts separately on its books for each item sold and presents the purchaser with separate bills for each item purchased . F , coin dealer , sells for currency $ 9 , 000 worth of gold coins to an individual on three successive days . Under paragraph -LRB- c -RRB- -LRB- 12 -RRB- -LRB- ii -RRB- of this section the three $ 9 , 000 transactions are related transactions aggregating $ 27 , 000 if knows , or has reason to know , that each transaction is one of series of connected transactions . -LRB- i -RRB- The term recipient means the person receiving the currency . Except as provided in paragraph -LRB- c -RRB- -LRB- 13 -RRB- -LRB- ii -RRB- of this section , each store , division , branch , department , headquarters , or office -LRB- ‘‘branch’’ -RRB- -LRB- regardless of physical location -RRB- comprising portion of a person \'s trade or business shall for purposes of this section be deemed separate recipient . -LRB- ii -RRB- branch that receives currency payments will not be deemed separate recipient if the branch -LRB- or central unit linking such branch with other branches -RRB- would in the ordinary course of business have reason to know the identity of payers making currency payments to other branches of such person . The following examples illustrate the application of the rules in paragraphs -LRB- c -RRB- -LRB- 13 -RRB- -LRB- i -RRB- and -LRB- ii -RRB- of this section : Example 1 . N , an individual , purchases regulated futures contracts at cost of $ 7 , 500 and $ 5 , 000 , respectively , through two different branches of Commodities Broker on the same day . N pays for each purchase with currency . Each branch of Commodities Broker transmits the sales information regarding each of N’ purchases to a central unit of Commodities Broker -LRB- which settles the transactions against N’ account -RRB- . Under paragraph -LRB- c -RRB- -LRB- 13 -RRB- -LRB- ii -RRB- of this section the separate branches of Commodities Broker are not deemed to be separate recipients ; therefore , Commodities Broker must report with respect to the two related regulated futures contracts sales in accordance with this section . P , corporation , owns and operates racetrack . P \'s racetrack contains 100 betting windows at which pari-mutuel wagers may be made . R , an individual , places currency wagers of $ 3 , 000 each at five separate betting windows . Assuming that in the ordinary course of business each betting window -LRB- or central unit linking windows -RRB- does not have reason to know the identity of persons making wagers at other betting windows , each betting window would be deemed to be separate currency recipient under paragraph -LRB- c -RRB- -LRB- 13 -RRB- -LRB- i -RRB- of this section . As no individual recipient received currency in excess of $ 10 , 000 , no report need be made by under this section .','-LRB- NN -RRB- NN IN NNS . DT VBG NNS VBP IN NNS IN DT NN -LRB- CD -RRB- NN .
